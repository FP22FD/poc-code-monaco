# POC for Monaco Editor

As we found our choice didn't allow real time editing, we needed to start again to look for a package. We found 2 choices: [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) (used by Visual Studio) and [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/).

PS. Highlightjs could do the work but it's via an unofficial package [highlighted-code](https://github.com/WebReflection/highlighted-code).
